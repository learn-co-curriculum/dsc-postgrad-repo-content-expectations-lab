# Expected Content - Lab


## Introduction

By now, you've used an example repository to review what an employer expects to read in a project notebook and README. In this Lab, you're asked to use the checklist to review your own project material. Use the lists below to review that each expected section is **in** your workbook and is able to answer the expected questions.

## Objectives

You will be able to:

- Review the minimum expectations of written data science project
- List what enhances a project from the minimum to the exceptional
- Compare the impact of rewritten sections to their original content


## Project Repository Checklist

### Title

   - [ ] Is the title desciptive?
  
### Business understanding

   - [ ] How much time will this solution save?
   - [ ] Who will this solution help?
   - [ ] What need does this analysis address?
   - [ ] How well does the metric or target variable directly relate to the real world problem?
   
### Data understanding

   - [ ] Where does the data come from?
   - [ ] What do the variables mean in actual language?
   - [ ] What is the target varialbe?
   - [ ] What is the range or scale of each variable?
   - [ ] Who is in the sample or how was the data colllected?
   - [ ] What elements of the data will or will not address the business question?
   - [ ] Are there any issues in term of data permissions, copy right, ethical issues, or confidential information?
   - [ ] Are there any interesting aspects or anomolies in the data such as outliers or missing data?
   - [ ] What additional data would be really helpful in your analysis?

### Data preparation

   - [ ] Can someone else replicate your entire data preparation process?
   - [ ] If you created the data through scraping or an API, can someone repeat that process?
   - [ ] In what form is the data stored?
   - [ ] There should be code that can take the raw data and get it ready for analysis, can be run again
   - [ ] Is the code in pipeline form?
   - [ ] Is all the preprocessing code in the notebook or is it in separate py files?
   
### Modeling

   - [ ] Is the information you are including absolutley relelvant?
   - [ ] Is your final model specified in an equation or pseudocode, and not just specified in code?
   - [ ] When you describe the parameter or ceoficients, do you describe it in real terms?
   - [ ] Have you examined any problems with the data that might be impacting the quallity of your analysi or model?
 
### Evaluation

#### Example questions about the model:
- [ ] What evaluation metrics did you use?
- [ ] Were there special considerations you made when choosing that evaluation metric?
- [ ] How does your model's metric compare to industry standards or what is already out there?
- [ ] Was cross vallidation included in your process and what concerns did that address?

#### Example questions about the application:

- [ ] What are the limitations of interpreting your analysis?
- [ ] What next steps would you take in this analysis? What new data would you want to incorperate?
- [ ] How well does your analysis answer the actual business question and concern?
- [ ] What sort of impact would your results actually have?

## README checklist

### Content summary

  - [ ] Detailed description of your business question
  - [ ] A summary of your data science process, findings, and ideas future improvement
  - [ ] At least one interesting visuallization from your analysis

### Roadmap
  - [ ] Repository navigation
  - [ ] Links to the presentation slides, notebook, and other relevant documentatin
  - [ ] Links to sources, such as the data, papers referenced, or other important materials

### How-to manual

  - [ ] Reproduction instructions
  - [ ] How to contact you information

## Summary

Congrats on making your Jupyter Notebook and README employer-ready!
